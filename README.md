### Project Overview

**Legend of Cosmos III** is a single-player, arcade-style space shooter where players pilot a customizable ship against endless waves of enemies. This repository marks the third iteration of the "Legend of Cosmos" series, rebuilt from the ground up using a modern web stack: **Phaser 3, TypeScript, and Webpack**.

The primary goal of this project is to evolve the roguelike concepts of *Legend of Cosmos II (Python/Pygame)* into a more polished, performant, and visually impressive experience, leveraging the power of the web for high-action gameplay.

### üéØ Core Concept

"Legend of Cosmos III" is an action-intensive shoot-'em-up that emphasizes player skill and deep ship customization. The core gameplay loop involves surviving chaotic waves of enemies, collecting resources, and using those resources in a "Hangar" between runs to permanently upgrade your ship. The key innovation lies in the modular ship design, allowing players to mix and match parts to create a unique playstyle.

### ‚ú® Key Features (Planned)

-   **üîß Modular Ship Customization:** Assemble your ship from five distinct parts: Main Laser, Secondary Laser, Ultimate Ability, Hull, and Drive. Each part has its own handcrafted upgrade path.
-   **üåä Dynamic Wave Spawning:** A two-part system generates enemy encounters. "Steady" spawns provide constant pressure, while scripted "Waves" create intense, set-piece challenges.
-   **üëæ Diverse Enemy Roster:** Battle a wide variety of foes, from simple Asteroids and cannon-fodder Ships to intelligent Hunters, drone-spawning Carriers, and shielded Astronauts.
-   **‚ö° High-Performance Canvas Rendering:** The entire game is rendered on an HTML5 `<canvas>` using the Phaser 3 engine, ensuring smooth, high-framerate action even with hundreds of entities on screen.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Data-Driven Architecture:** All ship parts, enemy stats, wave compositions, and upgrades are defined in external configuration files, making the game easy to balance, modify, and expand.

### üí° The "Why": Pygame vs. Phaser

The previous versions of this game served as valuable learning experiences in Unity and Pygame. This third version is an exercise in building a production-quality game with modern web technologies. Can we deliver the tight, responsive controls of an arcade classic while offering the deep customization of a modern roguelike? This project is an experiment to answer that question, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a browser-based game.

### üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This project is in the initial development phase. We are following a structured plan, building the game from the ground up. The current focus is on solidifying the core gameplay loop: player movement, shooting, enemy spawning, and the new multi-layered destruction effects.
